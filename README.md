Colors is the 1st of 25 Javascript projects I will be working on.
Colors is very simple. It is a webpage that features one button.
Upon clicking the button, the color of the entire webpage is changed to a random rgb color.
This webpage utilizes DOM manipulation, the click-eventListener, and Math methods.
